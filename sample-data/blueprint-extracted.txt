Bryan Johnson has the best aging score in the entire world (slowest speed of biological aging), with a personal best
of 0.48 and an average pace of 0.53 (starting from a PACE greater than 1 four years ago), now Bryan celebrates his
"biological Birthday" once every 24 months.
This document is designed to get you up to speed with our Speed of Aging tests, to teach you how to interpret your
results, and give you proven action points inspired by Bryan's journey in slowing down his biological age, so that you
too can achieve similar remarkable results.
Keen in mind: Biological Aging is mostly driven by the environment, habits and lifestyle choices and is malleable
to interventions.
Unlike chronological aging, biological aging is malleable and is a direct outcome of your behaviour and lifestyle
choices. A seminal study (3) in over 2000 twins (gold standard for studying genetic effects) found that longevity
was only 25% hereditary. In other words, your genes determine only 25% of your biological aging speed and
patterns, while the rest (75%) is up to you to decide and influence.
While all three markers of biological age are responsive, speed of aging is more dynamic in its response as it relies
on estimating the speed of aging from a snapshot in time, hence allowing quick feedback to new interventions and
lifestyle adjustments.
Biological Age will normally follow the speed of aging, with some delay for trends to appear.
Imagine a car changing its speed, you will be able to see the change directly at the speedometer (speed of aging)
much faster than seeing when you reach your destination based on the new speed.
Organ and System-specific biological age can show how certain interventions impact specific systems. For
example, exercise tends to have the most significant and rapid effect on musculoskeletal age and heart age, while
dietary improvements primarily influence liver and inflammation-related aging.
Taking action to counter your Biological Aging makes a huge difference

Think of this as the rate at which your body is aging, it is the speed at which your body and cells are epigenetically
aging, in other words it represents the speed at which your cells are accumulating methylation changes associated
with biological aging.
A pace of 1 means you are aging 1 year per calendar year, lower than 1 means you are aging slower, and higher than
1 means you are aging faster.
Example: a PACE of 0.5 means that you celebrate your "biological" birthday only once every two calendar years.
Purpose: Quantifies the rate at which your body is aging in months per year.
Mechanism: Uses a machine-learning algorithm developed by researchers at Duke University and Columbia
University, which was trained on longitudinal data (the Dunedin Study) to evaluate hundreds of DNA methylation
marks.
Performance: Offers high test–retest reliability (with intra-class correlation values above 0.98) and is sensitive to
lifestyle modifications.
What does it test and how to interpret your results?
PACE has higher association size with both physiological and self-assessed health markers. (1)
How is PACE better than earlier generations of epigenetic age clocks?

PACE score predicts the physiological, structural, and biochemical markers of aging and damage in the body.
Two examples here:
1. PACE predicts brain age (left) (1).
2. PACE predicts facial aging (right) (1), the picture is AI generated merging facial aging features of people all
chronologically 45, with increasing pace rates)
Experimentally, DunedinPACE has been shown as the best predictor of mortality, and age related decline
compared to earlier clocks.
In a recent evaluation of 16 biological aging clocks across 51 interventional studies, DunedinPACE stood out as
most reliable by always being either in agreement with a majority of the remaining clocks, or uniquely detecting a
change in biological age, where no other clock did (2).
Performance: Offers high test–retest reliability (with intra-class correlation values above 0.98) and is sensitive to
lifestyle modifications.

These methylation scores have been validated to correlate with biological markers of various organs and systems
in a representative cohort of 5000 participants. These scores help identify the drivers of overall speed of biological
aging and detect early risk factors for organ-specific diseases that might still be undetected through conventional
biomarkers.
Biological Age Clock (Organ Age Clock):
Purpose: Estimates overall biological age and the relative "age" of 11 organ systems, comparing these to
chronological age.
Mechanism: This clock analyzes methylation patterns at over 170 sites across the genome, integrating
system-specific clinical chemistry and functional measures. It was developed in collaboration with Yale
University scientists.
The Biological Age Score measures your overall epigenetic age up to the point of the test. Ideally you want to have
a biological age as low as possible, and definitely lower than your chronological age. This is based on all
components of 11 organs/systems biological aging clocks
The following figure shows the 3 steps of training of the clocks based on relevant markers for each organ/system.
These are a combination of phenotypic, structural, and biochemical markers.
Each organ clock analyzes a distinct combination of DNA methylation signatures to estimate an aging score for
that organ or system. Combining these scores across all systems provides a single biological age.

Understanding your aging type:
Imagine your organs and systems aging like a row of dominoes, except the sequence is unique to each person.
When one system begins aging more rapidly, it can set off a chain reaction, accelerating the aging of the next
system, and so on.
Organ age clocks identify your unique aging type, the sequence of your "aging dominoes". By understanding which
organs or systems are most vulnerable, you can take proactive steps to slow their decline and prevent premature
failure.
The problem with relying on a single Biological Clock measure is that it can mask the aging of individual organs,
potentially delaying intervention until it's too late. Once the domino effect starts, reversing the decline of the
weakest link may become impossible.
The following figure shows an example of three individuals all having comparable chronological and overall
biological (as a single measure) age. However, each individual has a very distinctive aging type affecting different
organs and systems.
Moreover, unlike conventional biomarkers, these novel organ age clocks offer a fully standardized and unified
measure of organ and system health and age for the first time. In comparison, conventional biomarkers can vary in
measurement methods between labs, leading to inconsistencies. Biological age clocks, on the other hand, all rely
on the same fully quantifiable DNA methylation signals, using standardized methods and algorithms for
quantifications. This ensures that your biological age tests will always be consistent and comparable (4).
How do Organ and System Age Clocks differ from systemic epigenetic aging clocks?

Generally retesting every year at least is recommended.
If you are making lifestyle improvements (e.g. starting the Blueprint Protocols and Stack) or if you are undergoing
new rejuvenation therapies (e.g. plasma exchange, HBOT) you might want to test more often to measure the effect
of these interventions on your biological age. In that case, testing twice a year or quarterly is preferred.
This is especially true for some interventions that have shown mixed results when put to test with epigenetic clocks
(e.g. Rapamycin, senolytics) or dietary or supplemental choices with varying effect based on genetics or
environmental factors (e.g. diets rich in red meat, antioxidant supplementation).
How often should I re-test?
Here is what distinguishes each of the 3 generation of epigenetic age clocks
1st Generation (Horvath, Hannum): created from data sets on people at different chronological ages (single
snapshot). While this clock predicts chronological age accurately, it is not strongly correlated to health and
longevity outcomes.
2nd Generation (GrimAge PhenoAge): created from data on different people (single snapshot) and trained beyond
chronological age to predict health biomarkers and mortality risk.
3rd Generation (DunedinPACE): the first to track the aging outcomes of participants across their lifespan based on
data from the same individuals from the age 3 to age 51.
Advantages of DunedinPACE:
Rules out noise in the data due to environmental exposures resulting from people living through different
times and in various places.
Instead of reporting biological age, or time to death, DunedinPACE reports the rate of decline and aging
experienced in the recent past (PACE: >1 aging fast, <1 aging slow), which makes it very responsive to
interventions and ideal for evaluating them with minimal lag and turnover time.
Experimentally, DunedinPACE has been shown as the best predictor of mortality, and age related decline
compared to earlier clocks.
In a recent evaluation of 16 biological aging clocks across 51 interventional studies, DunedinPACE stood out
as most reliable by always being either in agreement with a majority of the remaining clocks, or uniquely
detecting a change in biological age, where no other clock did.
How is Pace different from previous clocks like Horvath or GrimAge?

System Age algorithms are trained using markers specific to each organ or system. These markers are then
transformed into "Principal Components" which allow the algorithm to focus on detecting relevant methylation
signals for each component. For example, for the heart, relevant markers like BMI, lipids, and heart rate are
included. Each organ's clock is then abstracting several relevant markers, e.g. for heart: BMI, Lipids, heart rate, etc..
The clock for each organ is then trained to give a single marker for each participant, which is then used to estimate
the age of the organ/system.
How do we determine Organ and System ages from blood samples?
Think of DNA as a printed book, with the sequence representing the letters and worlds of the book. DNA
methylation (epigenetic signals) can be interpreted as a pencil or sticky notes with instructions on which
paragraphs to concentrate on or skip.
A DNA test (e.g. genome sequencing) measures the sequence (alphabet of 4 bases A,G,C, and T) of the DNA and
detects mutations (e.g. polymorphisms) and genotypes that change genetic predisposition to health and disease.
DNA methylation testing measures changes in the epigenetic regulation of the DNA, which controls gene
expression by turning genes on or off and adjusting their activity levels. In the context of aging, these changes can
cause cells to lose or "forget" their original identity and function, contributing to the aging process.
The Speed of Aging test algorithm measures the methylation level of DNA units that are linked to aging decline and
damage, and age related disease. (Refer to Q1 for more details)
How is DNA methylation different from a DNA test?
Telomeres are sequence repeats flanking the chromosomes and keeping the edges from being damaged, when
telomeres get too short, cells go into senescence. This drives aging both by hindering tissue regeneration and by
secreting damaging pro-aging signals known as SASP.
Telomere tests predict aging based on the length of the telomeres or the activity of the telomerase enzyme
responsible for regenerating the telomeres at every cell division.
How are telomere length tests different from epigenetic aging tests?

While the current aging clocks allow us to measure and predict biological aging at unprecedented accuracy and
detail, this field is still in its infancy. One reason is the existence of various generations of clocks. As explained
earlier, many studies in the scientific literature relied on 1st generation clocks in evaluating potential anti-aging
interventions, which lead to biases that still persist till today.
As an example, very recent research from Yale (a pre-print report 2)) evaluated various interventions (some
therapeutic for particular diseases and some with rejuvenation potential) using 16 epigenetic biological age clocks.
Besides showing that PACE was the most consistent and reliable clock in general, this research also uncovered
some surprising biases due to the over use of 1st generation clocks in the scientific literature.
Among the biggest surprises was that rapamycin seemed to accelerate biological aging on average, when
evaluated using all 16 clocks.
Here are some of the interventions that appeared to slow down aging according to this evaluation across 16
epigenetic clocks
1. Pharmacological Interventions: Anti-TNF therapy (anti-inflammatory), Metformin (Anti-diabetes, AMPK
activation),Ketamin (antidepressant psychedelic, dissociative).
2. Supplements: AC11 supplement (natural DNA repair booster), TruLacta (a human-milk based supplement).
3. Lifestyle Adjustments & Surgeries: Gastric Bypass (weight reduction), smoking cessation, kidney transplant, hyperbaric
oxygen therapy HBOT (large average effect, but no statistical significance)
4. Diets: Vegan Diet, Green Mediterranean Diet, Mediterranean Diet, low fat and low carb diets.
Here are some of the interventions that appeared to accelerate aging according to this evaluation across 16
epigenetic clocks
1. Pharmacological Interventions: Rapamycin (mTORC1 inhibitor, immunosuppressant), senolytics.
2. Supplements: Buckwheat Extract (rich in B vitamins)
3. Gene Therapies: Follistatin (myostatin inhibition, muscle growth)
4. Lifestyle Adjustments, procedures & surgeries: Kidney Dialysis
What are the interventions that decrease or increase biological age?

PACE was the only one to detect an effect (2).

Think of Pace as a speedometer and the biological age an overall result. As an example, we see a lot of low rates of
aging but high biological ages in ex-emergency medicine physicians. These physicians have had long shift-based
work and as a result, often poor nutrition and overall aging. However, when they get into the integrative medicine
space, their Pace starts to go down. However, it takes a longer time to correct the "aging damage" on the overall
biological age algorithms. In summary, the overall age is not the same output as the PACE.
How is my Pace of Aging low, but my biological age is high relative to my chronological age?
The inverse of the previous FAQ could also be true. You might have accumulated a low amount of "aging damage"
throughout most of your life because you had low stress, were sleeping well, and eating a diet that promotes
healthy aging, leading to a low biological age. However, due to recent changes in your lifestyle or nutrition, your
Pace might be a lot higher at the time you took the test.
How is my Pace of Aging high, but my biological age is low relative to my chronological age?
