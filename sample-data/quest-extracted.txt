Homocysteine is increased by functional deficiency of 
 
folate or vitamin B12. Testing for methylmalonic acid 
 
differentiates between these deficiencies. Other causes 
 
of increased homocysteine include renal failure, folate 
 
antagonists such as methotrexate and phenytoin, and 
 
exposure to nitrous oxide.

 METHYLMALONIC ACID

EZ
 
 
 
Serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels are used to diagnose
 
and monitor several rare inborn errors of metabolism,
 
including methylmalonic aciduria. The enzymatic conversion
 
of MMA to succinic acid requires vitamin B12
 
(adenosyl-cobalamin) as a cofactor. Serum MMA levels are
 
also used for assessing functional vitamin B12 deficiency.
 
Vitamin B12 is essential for fetal neurodevelopment,
 
particularly early in pregnancy. Undiagnosed maternal
 
vitamin B12 deficiency may be associated with adverse
 
fetal/neonatal outcomes, such as neural tube defects and
 
intrauterine growth restriction.
 
 
 
Quest Diagnostics utilized Multi-Modal Decomposition (MMD)
 
analysis to establish first and second trimester-specific
 
MMA reference intervals in pregnancy, as given below:
 
 
 
MMA, First trimester (<13 wks gestation): 58-167 nmol/L
 
MMA, Second trimester (13-23 wks gestation): 63-241 nmol/L
 
 
 
This test was developed and its analytical performance
 
characteristics have been determined by Quest Diagnostics.
 
It has not been cleared or approved by the FDA. This assay
 
has been validated pursuant to the CLIA regulations and is

ANA PATTERN 
Cytoplasmic  
 
The presence of cytoplasmic fluorescence was noted on the HEp-2 slide. Other reactivities (e.g., anti- mitochondrial antibodies or anti-smooth muscle
antibodies) may be responsible for this fluorescence. The clinical significance of this finding is uncertain. Clinical correlation is recommended.

Z4M
 
 This test was developed and its analytical performance characteristics have been determined by Quest Diagnostics Cardiometabolic Center of Excellence at Cleveland
HeartLab. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This assay has been validated pursuant to the CLIA regulations and is used
for clinical purposes. Increasing blood levels of long-chain n-3 fatty acids are associated with a lower risk of sudden cardiac death (1). Based on the top (75th percentile)
and bottom (25th percentile) quartiles of the CHL reference population, the following relative risk categories were established for OmegaCheck: A cut-off of >=5.5% by
wt defines a population at optimal relative risk, 3.8-5.4% by wt defines a population at moderate relative risk, and <=3.7% by wt defines a population at high relative risk
of sudden cardiac death. The totality of the scientific evidence demonstrates that when consumption of fish oils is limited to 3 g/day or less of EPA and DHA, there is no
significant risk for increased bleeding time beyond the normal range. A daily dosage of 1 gram of EPA and DHA lowers the circulating triglycerides by about 7-10% within 2
to 3 weeks. (Reference: 1-Albert et al. NEJM. 2002; 346: 1113-1118).

cardiovascular event risk category cut points (optimal, moderate, high) are based on an adult U.S. reference population plus two large cohort study populations.

A desirable treatment target may be <80 mg/dL or lower
depending on the risk category of the patient including
patients on lipid lowering therapies, patients with ASCVD,
diabetes with >1 risk factors, Stage 3 or greater CKD with
albuminuria, or  heterozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia. ApoB relative risk category cut
points are based on AACE/ACE and ACC/AHA recommendations
